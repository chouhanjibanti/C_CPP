Function :- A function is a block of code by using this we can perfrom the specific task.

A functions has three main parts :- 
1. Function declaration 
2. Function definition
3. Function calling

Notes:- 
-> A function never declare and define another function inside it.
-> One function can call another function , that is , we can call any function from any other function.
-> No matter in which order you have declared a function , the execution of function depends on function calling , not an function declaration order.
